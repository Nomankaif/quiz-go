        <div class="info-book">
        <h2 class="section-title">Book Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The book covers all the fundamental concepts of Python, starting with
          the basics and gradually progressing to more advanced topics. It is
          well-structured and suitable for readers with no prior programming
          experience.
        </p>
        <h2 class="section-title">Strengths</h2>
        <p>
          One of the book's strengths is its clear and concise explanations. The
          author does an excellent job of breaking down complex concepts into
          easily understandable language. The numerous examples and exercises
          provided in the book are particularly helpful for reinforcing
          learning.
        </p>
        <h2 class="section-title">Weaknesses</h2>
        <p>
          While the book is great for beginners, it might not be comprehensive
          enough for more experienced programmers looking for in-depth Python
          knowledge. Additionally, some readers might prefer more extensive
          coverage of certain advanced topics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite these minor drawbacks, "Python Programming for Beginners"
